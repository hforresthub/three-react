Just a playground for threeJS, React, and Firebase.

Click a sphere to take control of it (or create a new one via the form inputs), then use wasd keys and c and space to move around if you have a keyboard, or on mobile swipe up/down/left/right or tab the sphere.  Updates the firebase database with your movements so others can see your changes in realtime.
